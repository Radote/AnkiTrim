# AnkiTrim

Many of us have loads of great Anki cards, but don't _need_ all of them. We need to prioritize. But how are you going to trim a bunch of your cards by hand? That's where AnkiTrim comes in. It'll prompt an LLM (of your choice) to decide which cards are most valuable, and which need to go.


### Note: This project is still very much WIP
